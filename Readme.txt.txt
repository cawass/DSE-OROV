# DSE-OROV Project

Welcome to the DSE-OROV project! This project is focused on the development and optimization of orbital refueling operational vehicles (OROVs) for space exploration.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to research the possibility of a spacecraft that could refuel using the atmosphere. This includes designing, simulating, and optimizing the performance of OROVs to enhance their capabilities in space exploration.
